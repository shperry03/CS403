This program is designed to interpret and execute files written in the Lox language, derived from CraftingInterpreters.com.
The results of output are directed to the command line. 

Due to the fact that this Lox interpreter is written in C#, we opted to create a dotnet application for our program to run on.
This means that dotnet version 3.1 or greater must be installed on the machine to run this Lox interpreter.

CREATING TEST FILES:
    To generate test files, the user must simply create a new .txt file in the same directory as
    the C# files (Project2/), with correct Lox syntax.

RUNNING TEST FILES:
    The following command is used to execute a Lox file in the terminal:
    > dotnet run "filename"

    Example: Testfile --> TestLox1.txt
    Execution: dotnet run TestLox1.txt

    The output will be written in the console for the user to view.

RUNNING CODE LINE BY LINE:
    The user may also choose to execute Lox commands one at a time, 
    by running the following command (don't specify a filename):
    > dotnet run 

    Once this command is executed, a Lox prompt will begin running, in which the user can input simple Lox statements.

COMPILATION / RUN INSTRUCTIONS
1. Ensure that an up-to-date dotnet version is installed on your machine (verify using dotnet --list-sdks).
2. Execute the command "dotnet run 'filename'" to run a pre-written Lox file, or "dotnet run" to open the line-by-line Lox prompt.
3. That's it! Your Lox interpreter should be good to go.
